# Trio-task

This is a Flask application that is set up and configured to work with a database and nginx. Write a docker-compose.yaml that will bring all these services up and allow the app to run on port `80`.

For each build, we have to remove the containers and images, if not the jenkins build will fail as it is duplicated.
